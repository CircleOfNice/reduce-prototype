# ReducePrototype

This package contains two little helper functions to work with the prototype chain of an object or a class.

# Usage

Just use the functions below as if you would reduce any other iterable, with the only exception, that a fourh parameter
sets a constructor which stops the iteration if it's prototype occurs.

```js
import { reducePrototypeChain, reduceInheritanceChain } from "reduce-prototype"

class A {
    test() {}
}

class B {
    test2() {}
}

class C extends A {
    test3() {}
}

const instance = new C();

// now we have the methods test, test2 and test3 in our array
const allMethods = reducePrototypeChain(instance, (dest, proto) => dest.concat(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(proto)), [])
    .filter(key => instance[key] instanceof Function)
    .map(key => instance[key]);

// now we have the methods test2 and test3 in our array
const bAndCMethods = reduceInheritanceChain(C, (dest, proto) => dest.concat(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(proto)), [], A)
    .filter(key => instance[key] instanceof Function)
    .map(key => instance[key])
```

# Testing

You can test `reducePrototype` with mocha by executing ```make test``` in the root directory of the project.
